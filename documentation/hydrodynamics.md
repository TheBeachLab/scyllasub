# Hydrodynamics
Anything related with the hydrodynamics of the rov. This section is related to [energy](energy.md).

A nice concept is [this one](http://contest.techbriefs.com/2012/entries/safety-and-security/2685) since the is no need to have an internal volume. In theory a perfect cylinder does not displace water.

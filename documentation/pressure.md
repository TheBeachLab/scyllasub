At 2000 meters depth pressure is 200 atm, meaning 200kg/cm2. At 4000 m, it is 400kg/cm2.

An idea for designing the overall vehicle, if we were to fill the entire vehicle with some electronics compatible fluids, like [fluorinert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorinert), we can withstand a lot of pressure without a strong body. Also such liquids can serve as coolant.

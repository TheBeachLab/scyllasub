# ROV Control

Anything related with the control of the rov: motor control, surfaces control and buoyancy control. This section related to [buoyancy](buoyancy.md), [positioning](positioning.md) and [pressure](pressure.md).

ROV requires the following sensors for static:
* Compass (north direction)
* 3 axis accelerometer (pitch, row, yaw angles)
* Depth sensor (up to 400 atm)

For dynamic variables:
* 3 axis gyroscope (X,Y,Z angular rate deg/s)
